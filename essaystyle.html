	<h2>1. Good design is innovative</h2> 
  	<p>a. Technologies change and improve constantly and good design must seek to push itself to the limits.<br>
    b. Wireless charging, as the technology gets better all our device can be charged wirelessly. <br>
    c. I have not thought about innovating during my design process, but I do think it is important. I should at the very least think about the possibility of innovating.</p>

	<h2>2. Good design makes a product useful</h2>
	<p>a. The point of a product is to be useful to the consumer and detachment from that is not good design.<br>
	b. My water bottle is exactly what I expect and nothing more <br>
	c.  For example the goal of a poster can be to tell the audience of an event, and this will have priority over other details. I have designed posters for an event and I made sure it was useful in explaining the details of the event.</p>
	
	<h2>3. Good design is aesthetic</h2> 
	<p>	a. Good design is Aesthetics because they contribute to the consumers enjoyment of the product. <br>
	b. I think my laptop is pretty, and apple definitely considers aesthetic among other things.<br>
	c. I think this is always a goal of designers.</p>

	<h2>4. Good design makes a product understandable</h2> 
	<p>a. The product must be simple to use for it to be good design. The best design allows for the product to instruct the consumer.<br>
	b. I use a toothbrush that has different setting and each setting has a button with an icon. I have never read the instructions but because of the buttons and icons I can understand the product. <br>
	c. I have designed a card game and I think I was able to distinguish the different suites using only 3 or 4 different shapes and patterns.</p>
	
	<h2>5. Good design is unobtrusive</h2>
	<p>	a. Products that have a job should not be pretty for the sake of being pretty. Instead should look neutral and leave the expression to the consumer.<br>
	b. I use a pan for eggs, it is basically just a small pan. It is not some crazy device and I think it follows this principle. <br>
	c. I have not used this principle, a lot of the time for me I have designed things that want to attract attention.</p>
	
	<h2>6. Good design is honest</h2>
	<p>a. Good design does not over promise on the products capabilities.<br>
	b. A lot of the time we see over promising from companies from tech to clothing. So more companies should follow this.<br>
	c. I would never want to overpromise on my abilities as a designer and it is important for me to understand that I am learning and developing my skills.</p>
	
	<h2>7. Good design is long-lasting</h2>
	<p>a. It does not attempt to be trendy, so to never be outdated. <br>
	b. I’d say Apple headphones, I don’t think the design has changed much over the years. <br> 
	c. I think I’d like to think my designs are long-lasting, but usually after a week I cringe at my decisions.</p>
	
	<h2>8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail</h2>
	<p>a. Every small detail must be looked at and considered in the design process. <br>
	b. I don’t really know, I’d like to think all my products I own went through a thorough design process.<br>
	c. I think with every typography project I had to think about</p>

	<h2>9. Good design is environmentally-friendly</h2>
	<p>a. Good design will not harm the environment, in the process of making the product and after the product is out of use. <br>
	b. I have a set of bamboo utensils that are a better alternative to plastic utensil. <br>
	c. I don’t usually consider this principle or I haven’t really had the chance to.</p>
	
	<h2>10. Good design is as little design as possible</h2>
	<p>a. Keep it simple and don’t over design something. <br>
	b.I own this small speaker, it has two buttons and that’s about it. I think they did a good job keeping the form simple and compact. <br>
